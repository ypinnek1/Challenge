Concepts:

    A user first has to register when visits for the first time by entering his name.
    Then a list is populated, (Existing employees list - which is in a user object, which can be modified to verify the group generating algorithm) which shows the employees in the company.
    Based on the users selection (Coffee or Lunch), he will be matched with employees (group generating algorithm prioritizes people you haven't had lunch with before).

    Used different types of selectors in SCSS (class, ID, attribute, element).
    Followed BEM methodology wherever applicable.

    Used Modular pattern in vanilla JS without any helper modules (used IIFE's & Closures). 
    Created a custom Modal.
    Used Local Storage.
